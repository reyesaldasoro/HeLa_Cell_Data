# Hela-Cell-Data
Data Corresponding to HeLa-Cell-Segmentation

This repository contains only the data, both as folders with tiff images and matlab files of the HeLa cells as 2000x2000x300 that have been extracted from the larger 8000x8000x519 volumes. For code and description see below.

## Parallel repository to HeLa-Cell-Segmentation
